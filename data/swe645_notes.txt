AI agents are systems that can perceive their environment, reason about it, and take actions to achieve goals.
Traditional AI systems are often single-shot predictors, for example a classifier that outputs a label.

Business Continuity Planning (BCP) focuses on keeping critical operations running during a disruption.
Disaster Recovery (DR) focuses on restoring IT systems and data after an incident.
